These are the scripts complementary to the paper "Inferring insect feeding patterns based on sugar profiles:a comparison of statistical methods" published in Ecological Entomology (Appendix S11). To download them, click the "Code" tab (in green) and then click on "Download ZIP".

Read "README - How to use the scripts" for a detailed guide on how to use the scripts.

For now, these are the first versions of the script. Updates will be described here.
